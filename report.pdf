This is a placeholder PDF for the AI Tools Assignment report.

Please generate the actual PDF report by:
1.  Compiling the answers from:
    *   `part1_theory/theoretical_questions.md`
    *   `part3_ethics_optimization/ethics_and_optimization.md` (including the troubleshooting section)
2.  Including screenshots of model outputs from the Jupyter Notebooks:
    *   `part2_practical/task1_sklearn/iris_classification.ipynb` (e.g., classification report, accuracy scores)
    *   `part2_practical/task2_tensorflow_pytorch/mnist_cnn.ipynb` (e.g., model accuracy, sample prediction visualizations, training history plots)
    *   `part2_practical/task3_spacy/amazon_reviews_nlp.ipynb` (e.g., extracted entities and sentiment output)
3.  Adding any other required sections, such as group member names, introduction, conclusion, and ethical reflection summary.
4.  If the bonus task was completed, include screenshots and a link to the live demo.

This placeholder is created because automated generation of a formatted PDF with embedded images and diverse content is beyond the current capabilities. You can use tools like Pandoc (Markdown to PDF) or manually compile it in a word processor.
